"1","9sa8ku","Let's brainstorm and recruit. A lot of people on reddit want to do something about this. I will also be looking for moderators. , I liked the crowdfunding idea. , I think it's the only way, so we would have to start by crowdfunding a non-profit. , Perhaps there could be a page of land sale listings in Brazil or any other country and people could donate towards that. 

For example: http://www.brazilpropertygroup.com/farms/

Has several thousand acre farms for sale from 200 to 1000 an acre. With some wealthy backers theres a good chance we could secure tens of thousands of acres, I like this. We set tangible goals and donate towards it. No general mystery funds. , Let me know if I can help in any way, So what I'd like to figure out is what the best kind of non-profit would be for our needs. Excuse me if I'm centering this around myself a bit, but I am thinking we start by making it in the United States. , I think we need to do some research on who we would buy the land from and for how much. , Definitely, the issue with that is there's still a lot of unknowns coming with the change in power, but I'm sure we can start getting an idea based off of what's already for sale., Maybe a good first step is to start a go fund me for rainforest preservation. It would be an easy way to make money for the cause., I'm hesitant to start a gofundme or something similar before we have some sort of non-profit for the money to go to. Once we have something set up then I'm all for it. , Im in,  but agree we need an organization that will fight to protect the rainforest, not just take money amd bow down to the government.  This is really bigger than all of us., Not if we combine our strengths and look past our weaknesses, Making it open to other nationalities would help a lot. I know it might often seem like most people on the internet are American because we share the same language, but that is not the case. And, no offence, but Americans voted for Trump. Unfortunately, that affects the whole world and we had no choice on the matter. Now, I'm not an expert in non-profit organisations, but shouldn't there be an option to make them international?, Is it okay if I post this sub to a couple of other environmental subs to spread awareness?, That would help a ton, please do, Just posted a couple and I’ll post some more in the morning. Let me know if there is anything else I can do , You're doing great thank you, this is definitely gonna be a number's game. , I'm down. I spend all my time doing activism. Mostly vegan activism. Hear me out. 

I'm not really an 'animal lover' tbh. But I know injustice when I see it. And what we are doing to non-human animals is unjust. So I'm vegan for them. But if that was all, I'd simply change my diet and shopping habits and go about my life.  

Turns out though, animal agriculture is a leading cause of not only global warming in general, but rainforest destruction in particular. Humans have got to stop consuming animal products if my son's to have any kind of future on this planet. So thus far, I've been focusing on reducing demand by encouraging people to move toward veganism. 

So I'm with you. I'm totally down.  It's time to rise up and fight these fascists. , Hey I’m only in high school so there isn’t really much I can do but what you guys are doing is really great. It’s nice to see people actually doing something, It doesn't matter where you are, we can all do our part. It just takes a bit of out of the box thinking. Learn more about biology and chemistry, limit meat consumption, take public transport, share ideas, recycle, there is so much that you can do. , You being younger is your best weapon. You're more resilient and have a (theorhetically barring a tragedy) longer period of time to make changes. I'm 30. I *wish* I had been 'woke' when I was still in high school. I got so caught up in the competition aspect of education (more accurately, my feelings of inadequacy in that competition) that it ruined my life. I gave up because I wasn't in the top percentile of my class and I figured I was a failure so what was the point of pouring everything I had into it? 

You still have the opportunity to NOT do that. You seem to realize already that the competition race isn't what it's marketed as and you see it for the facade it is. 

Your brain is young and hungry for learning. Feed it, Seymour!
Your body is young and hungry for action. DO something! Before the aching back and cracking knees find you!, I'd suggest someone get in touch with Ecosia. They're an organization that plants trees around the world every time you search something through their search engine (which runs very adequately compared to google and especially to bing). They've got an app too.

&amp;#x200B;

It's one thing to buy the land, but there's also a ton of areas in the Amazon that are already devastated. Restoring the rainforest is another option we should strive for.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps someone at Ecosia could offer some insight into how their project got started, funding (I know the ads on their search engine pay for a lot of it), what assistance/ advice they could offer., This is a great idea. , I also suggest using their search engine in general. It's a great chrome extension!, As of this comment, they have planted 40,898,428 trees worldwide., Id suggest looking into using the Miyawaki forest planting method. He did a ted talk about it and has been very successful. Traditional tree planting methods are not always successful, but he has developed a method that can plant a forest that grows bigger faster and is way more resilient. The method plants mixes of native plants in close proximity to each other in a way that they help each other grow instead of competing with each other. If we are going to accomplish this, we need to go for the best options and research the hell out of it., https://www.ted.com/talks/shubhendu_sharma_how_to_grow_a_forest_in_your_backyard/details here is a link to the ted talk for some inspiration and education., Holy crap! This Ecosia concept is awesome! Why is this not more popular??, Right? It’s incredible. And the organization is transparent as heck., Because most people don't know about it I assume. Never heard of it before that comment. Put it as my default search engine on Chrome. , Best of luck in your endeavors! Please keep us updated so that we can help when ever possible. , Will do, thanks for joining, Hi everyone. Let’s make some specific smaller goals other than the obvious larger one. While I haven’t read about his platform exactly I assume it is something like “cutting down the forest will bring lumber and money into the economy eventually leading to valuable farm lands. So in order to fight this we have to look at it from all sides. , If you would like to research his policies that would be very helpful, Define research? I am in graduate school in the US and I get way over zealous about research so I don’t want to overwhelm anyone. I am a sociologist so I am interested in how this change in going to impact different populations in the area. But again just buying up land won’t do anything if people are starving or incredibly poor. If you have a lot of low income people near something that could provide income (albeit in a harmful and unsustainable way) little will get done., Sure, that was pretty vague on my part. You mentioned his policies, maybe start by trying to present his Amazon related policies to the group? Any of his personal connections to logging or cattle companies are also important to know. 
You're also right that the human element must be addressed. Improving the quality of life for those living near wildlife is something being done in central Africa, and combined with education and outreach it has helped in the conservation of habitat for mountain gorillas. , Employ them to protect the forest. Boom, they have a job and we are closer to our goal.
, Howdy! I’m a political science major at Cal Poly and am about as concerned as can be. If Bolsonaro goes through with this “great green rush,” we will lose one of the greatest natural resources on the planet.

I’d love to help out in any way possible. I like the idea of starting a nonprofit. Are you thinking of pursuing nonprofit status in Brazil or establishing a corporation within Brazil that’s owned by a nonprofit from the United States?, That's what we're trying to figure out, I'll make a separate post for it, I believe one of the things we can do is informing our peers. I feel by explaining the severity of this situation to people itd bring more people into action. 

We could make flyers (we could organize locally or make a template). 

Make articles post them here or put them on a blog or something along those lines.
, Agreed, I think this is a great idea. Is anyone into design that could make a template?, 1. Buy a ton of a small crytpo currency
2. Spam 4chan with that crypto
3. Autists buy it and price goes up
4. Repeat for profit
I think it could work, ...I'll make a separate post for funding, Be very careful about cryptos. They are hard to get your head around without studying for many hours which could be better spent doing something for the planet, The highest iq plan., Let’s turn that 2,000 into 200,000, Just subscribed, watching atm.
Interested in concept. 

Question- ok you buy some rainforest, cool.
How are you going to protect it without feet on the ground?
Every protected area on this planet has problems... how are you going to really stop people just going to 'your' land and doing whatever?, Because of the proliferation of illegal logging in Brazil, you're absolutely right. We would have to hire security, preferably locals.  , It's a big problem? 
Expect Local corruption upheld by government forces?

Your idea is good, just don't let idealism fog your view on reality.
This is going to be expensive and ongoing.

Don't think I'm trying to drag you down, view it that I'm sitting on the bonnet of your truck calling out potholes in the road?

But yes I agree in concept...if we ignore what's happening around us?...we are going to lose this precious planet., Oh for sure, it's something to be aware of. We maybe wouldn't hire exclusively locals for that reason and have some recruits from other countries. I do believe that many in Brazil, especially indigenous people in the Amazon will be sympathetic to the cause though. , The locals would make the best security. All that you'd need to do is pay them a bit more than they would earn by farming/ chopping the trees, which is very little compared to American wages, so it is doable., Hey, I'm a Marine Ecologist from the UK living in New Zealand. I'm 100% in to help wherever needed, I'm feeling so exasperated by the current situation in Brazil (and worldwide) that I'm so fucking happy a group like this exists. I can't bear to feel like I'm not taking action somehow!

Good luck everyone, Brazil was the last straw for me. While I know what I want from a climate change fighting NGO, we're now in the process of figuring out how to get there. How and where to start a non-profit are some of the things we need help hashing out, but there's plenty else to do too. , I'm going to get started by spreading the word, and I'll have a think about what else I can offer in the meantime. Props to you for getting this going., Don't forget to cheer on [The ocean cleanup](https://www.theoceancleanup.com/) for being the only active attempt to remove all plastic debris from our oceans, Hey, I would love to help. I can't really donate, because I am a student, but I want to help by spreading the word!, I'm getting the impression that a lot of us are students, everything helps, I think there are some options for companies to work with for sure. [https://www.patagonia.com/new-localism/bears-ears.html](https://www.patagonia.com/new-localism/bears-ears.html)

As an example, Patagonia was pretty vocally opposed to Trump's plans for Bears Ears. Maybe looking at what they did and what companies or organizations tried to help them could be useful? Patagonia also seems like a decent option since Yvon Chouinard (the founder) and the late founder of North Face bought a lot of land in Argentina or Chile I believe as a conservation effort. , Please let me know if there is any way I can help with the group. I haven’t moderated a sub before, but let me know what your needs are, and if I can, I will!, All this help is great, we sorely need research, recruiting/ spreading the word is great, as is any general brainstorming , That I can do!!, We need to fight against defeatism and fatalism. I think it is vital, so we can gain more recruits and raise spirits., Absolutely, if you've ever been to r/collapse that's basically the whole sub. Everyone there is just as disturbed as we are but instead of fighting they've chosen to give up. , Crowdfund to sponsor environmental activists in Brazil to afford to attend protests?, Only if they're aware that Bolsanaro won't hesitate to kill them. If an individual is truly dedicated I would support this, but this could possibly send someone to their death. , As brutal as it sounds, that may actually work in our favor. If Bolsanaro were to kill a peaceful environmental activist from America for no reason other than their peaceful environmental activism, I envision it would be a shitstorm that leaves the Khashoggi situation in the rearview. , You might reach more people by creating other social media accounts for r/ClimateOffensive.

"3","9sak1k","[removed], Its general but it's good. Go big or go home!

It's an attention grabber, a lot of people don't even know whats happening so this would rise awareness ""bloody reddit are on some mad campaign. They are trying to buy THE AMAZON!""   ""Why?!""


And if we can make life difficult for the new boss then maybe he won't just be able to sweep in amd do what he wants., Certainly could work for marketing purposes as I suspect many would donate to help with such an ambitious goal. That might make for an interesting Coke marketing campaign.  Buy a coke, save a square foot. 1 acre is 43560 sqft. Say the acre costs 100 bucks. $0.002 per coke seems affordable. , I definitely think that reaching out to a company like that (especially one that has either already been active in saving the environment) would be a great step towards reaching the masses. Also a company that has a mascot, reputation, etc. associated with an animal, plant, or other feature in the rainforest might be more willing to help out since it'd be an easy marketing campaign for them. 

&amp;#x200B;

A hypothetical example would be getting Coke to do something with polar bear conservation. (Maybe they already are... idk), but because they've been their mascot before, their marketing team might be more inclined to participate.

&amp;#x200B;

It's late here, so I'm having a hard time coming up with examples, but if anyone can brainstorm companies who might have a marketable reason for saving the rainforest, that would be great., Don’t know specifically about the Amazon but in Australia where I live there are lots of tourism companies that profit directly from taking people to and touring them around (such as the Blue Mountains, Daintree, especially the Great Barrier Reef), so if there are any equivalents they’d all work., Oh yeah, I'm certain that tourism would drop immensely if the Amazon was destroyed, so that makes me even more concerned for the nation of Brazil. 

But I was meaning more along the lines of a superficial connection. Like Froot Loops having a toucan mascot, so maybe Kellogg's could have a cheeky marketing stunt where for every box sold, a portion of the proceeds goes towards saving the rainforest.

Not sure if a company like that would want to get involved in the politics of this situation., They'll follow the money. Show a company that they can directly profit from supporting some cause and they'll jump right in, even huge companies like Keloggs., While metaphorically speaking, it might seem like you're just plugging up the holes as they keep happening, replanting the trees that will be cut down and that have already been cut down over the last couple centuries is a must, imo.

&amp;#x200B;

I've already mentioned Ecosia and their search engine on another thread, but there are non profits and such that are doing a lot of great work. Some communication with them would likely be extremely beneficial.

[https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/restore-rainforest/](https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/restore-rainforest/), We could take that route as well. Do we want to be restorers or protectors? Each route has different implications. , Different implications sure, but they are both necessary. Restoration without protection is futile, but there's plenty of land that needs to be restored and then protected. Plus, by the time any protection efforts are well under way, there will be a large area of land that will have been destroyed by his awful plan.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps restoration is the PHASE 2 of this Climate Offensive after the area is protected, but I think that organizing it now wouldn't hurt., I have been digging around the internet and am finding that buying land is not as viable as one might assume given the lack of government control in these countries. Restoration may be a more viable path. , What's to stop them from cutting the restored area down a few years in the future? I believe we should focus on protection of large areas of rainforest. Perhaps consider forming protected corridors and focusing on more biodiverse areas. These areas will help restore the damage done by other entities, as it's easier to restore an area surrounded by biodiverse nature than one completely clearcutted or monocultivated. 

This could be done by making accords with the local governments, hiring local people to help preserve it and guard it from invaders., My 2c - We need a list of all major/ commonly known environmental geographic areas under threat (Amazon, Great barrier reef, arctic, antarctic etc.), current threats to the habitats (Deforestation, oil rigs, warming oceans) and politicians to contact or other ways people can act, That is an overwhelmingly large list though and in that case we would become like a router for people to find where to help instead of a group taking direct action. An intriguing option and not one I considered. , Maybe we should have subgroups with every state / every major metropolitan area, so there are more localized resources and events. A cool event would be to get together and do a beach garbage clean up, plant trees, or something similar to those events. It would also be cool if we could do a go fund me that we bought up land but were able to use it as well as preserve it, like doing community gardens and hiking trails. , ","We are going to need specific goals if we are to succeed.

"4","9sak1l","I personally think we should pursue non-profit status in the U.S., but do not know the specifics. People with knowledge on the subject, this is where we need you, I’ve volunteered at a few nonprofits, and most of my knowledge is on the grant writing side of things, but here’s a link that sounds like what you may need:

https://grantspace.org/resources/knowledge-base/starting-a-nonprofit/, Thank you so much, No worries. If you need help reviewing grant proposals or finding grant foundations that could be interested in your non-profit, just shoot me a pm and I’ll see what I can do.

I’m by no means a professional, but I did get trained for writing grant proposals. , Will do, that link helped a lot , It seems like it may be a bit of a hassle working out of the United States, but it may be feasible. We would need to work within the bounds of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, which – luckily for us – [has not sanctioned any Brazilian companies, at the moment](https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/consolidated/consolidated.xml). [As a 501(c)(3) we would not be able to act as a ""money conduit.""](https://www.501c3.org/charitable-activities-in-a-foreign-country/) This would mean we wouldn't be able to form a nonprofit organization in the United States for the sole purpose of funding a Brazilian organization which would purchase land.

Another problem I could see arising is that our expressed goal does not exactly fit within the exempt purposes required for a 501(c)(3). [According to the IRS,](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exempt-purposes-internal-revenue-code-section-501c3)
&gt;The term charitable is used in its generally accepted legal sense and includes relief of the poor, the distressed, or the underprivileged; advancement of religion; advancement of education or science; erecting or maintaining public buildings, monuments, or works; lessening the burdens of government; lessening neighborhood tensions; eliminating prejudice and discrimination; defending human and civil rights secured by law; and combating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency.

I'm not positive, but perhaps we could argue that we are ""lessening the burdens of government"" or ""preventing community deterioration,"" but otherwise we may need to expand the operations of the organization to include a purpose that is exempt.

, Why not start it directly in Brazil? Operate from a Brazilian perspective. We absolutely need Brazilian members to gain a foothold on the local situation., This. [We also would not be able to purchase rural land without Brazilian residence, and as a foreign company we would only be able to purchase rural land with the intent to develop agricultural projects](http://thebrazilbusiness.com/article/how-to-buy-real-estate-in-brazil). 

We definitely need Brazilian members to get this project afloat. Plus, without a firm grasp of Portuguese we won’t be getting very far., As a Brazilian-based non-profit, can we then also register in the U.S.?, We could. We would have to register as a foreign nonprofit, but it seems that we could still apply for tax exempt status in the U.S. as a Brazilian nonprofit., I like the sound of that, in order to be Brazil based do we need to be started by a Brazilian? I think we all want this to be international, As far as I’m aware, there is no requirement that we need to be Brazilian to found a nonprofit there. We may need a someone with Brazilian citizenship or a permanent residence visa to act as Company Administrator, but I’m not positive it’s required for nonprofits., I think we should start start in both places, we need the United States for funding , If you crowdfund, does it really matter which country the funds come from? What about Europeans that want to help? European here., Being recognized as a non-profit gives a tax exempt status in that particular country, and since this is a global issue and a global fight we'd want that everywhere. I think the question is where to get recognition first to get off the ground, although I'm very much piecing this together as I go. , In that case, maybe make in in Brazil first? Make the nonprofit in Brazil, but crowdfund from everywhere else. Maybe., This sounds more reasonable. I'm based in EU and Mexico. Not every person willing to help on the project is from the US. I think we should base the non-profit on the country we will be working on, unless there is a political/bureaucratic  reason not to. 

I think it will give us more freedom of operation in the nation, without having to ask for permisions and such to export the money and buy land. We definitely need a man or a few on the ground tho. We should prioritize on finding someone willing to help that is Brazilian and has at least some grasp on the situation there. We can work together from there, having him as a local foundation. 

Scouting, research on laws and lands, collaborations with other associations, fundraising, marketing can all be done remotely as this is an international endeavour.

https://www.conservation.org/

They have a really holistic approach towards conservation (focuses on policies, research, collaboration with companies and leaders etc.), and has a lot of expertise. Maybe we could reach out and ask for some ideas, guidance etc! , Why do we need to set up our own nonprofit? Can we not work thru existing organizations with track records?, I think we do need to work with existing non-profits like you said, but there may be cases where we are willing to do more. Outside of the Amazon fight I can think of several climate issues where no non-profits are involved. , What climate issues have no non-profits working on them?, Absolutely. Don’t start a new non-profit especially as a bunch of foreigners. Support existing organizations doing good work., The problem with non-profit status is it ties you up with a lot of legal and compliance regulation which costs money and time to do. Not saying it shouldn't be done, but it needs thinking about?, It makes more sense to me than trying to claim we're a for-profit business, and I'm not sure what other options there are. Tax exemptions will certainly be important. , Yes I see your point of course. I personally think non-profit is always going to deliver a more powerful message to stakeholders.

"6","9saphb","Our first step will be to draft a mission statement. I'm all for fighting climate change in general but current focus is definitely on Brazil , From grantspace: The mission statement communicates the nonprofit's purpose, what groups it serves, and how it plans to do so. For a new nonprofit, developing the mission statement is a critical first step in defining what the organization plans to do and what makes it different from other organizations in the same field. , My take:

The Climate Offensive refuses to believe that all there is left to do is sit back and brace for our impending climate doom. We will do whatever we think helps, wherever it isn't being done.

I would like to help spread the word!, Hi! If you are broke then you can make [https://www.ecosia.org/](https://www.ecosia.org/) your default search engine and search and click ads (they also have and android app). They will fund many reforesting organizations, including those who wish to restore the atlantic forest in brasil PACTO ([http://www.bonnchallenge.org/content/brazils-atlantic-forest-restoration-pact](http://www.bonnchallenge.org/content/brazils-atlantic-forest-restoration-pact)) .  I donate monthly to reforestation projects all over the world. Last month my donation went to [https://edenprojects.org/](https://edenprojects.org/). I can donate to the Rainforest trust, but I need to investigate how big their impact will be in comparison to to other projects. My current opinion is that illegal logging is almost impossible to stop due to the sheer size of the land and the number of people who subsist through these activities. So I think the planting needs to outpace the deforestation and at the same time we transition many individuals to plant trees that may have initially been logging through employment. Thank you for your effort, the amazon needs our help more than ever now!, How about this for a game plan: we find out which of those organisations does the job best i.e. buys up the land while making sure the land is protected from illegal poaching by recruiting natives, work with them(donating/advertising) and make a non-profit that buys up the farms next to the rainforest and plants trees there? That way we would be fighting on both fronts and might not just stop it from disappearing, but also bring it back., Going by Charity Navigator, Conservation International scores slightly higher than Rainforest Trust. Both get top marks in 'Accountability and Transparency', but CI scores a little higher in 'Financial' than RT. Their mission statements are very different though. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Conservation International** has the following mission statement: 

&gt; Conservation International (CI) applies innovations in science, economics, policy and community participation to protect the Earth's richest regions of plant and animal diversity and demonstrate that human societies can live harmoniously with nature. Founded in 1987, CI works in more than 40 countries on four continents to help people find economic alternatives without harming their natural environments. Building upon a strong foundation of science, partnership and field demonstration, CI empowers societies to responsibly and sustainably care for nature for the well-being of humanity. Conservation International is committed to helping societies adopt a more sustainable approach to development - one that considers and values nature at every turn.

&amp;nbsp;

**Rainforest Trust** has the following mission statement: 

&gt; Established in 1988, Rainforest Trust works around the tropics to strategically purchase and protect lands vital for endangered species and indigenous communities. We specifically target the most threatened tropical habitats that are critical for preventing species extinctions and that are exceptionally rich in biological diversity. Celebrating 30 years of lasting conservation action, we are proud to have saved more than 18 million acres of tropical habitat across 40 countries in 130 protected areas and wildlife reserves. 

&amp;nbsp;

If we are to focus our efforts on one of the two, we need to agree which one lines up better with our immediate efforts. CI has a slightly better 'Financial' score, meaning they distribute the funds more effectively, but the difference is close to negligible - either one is a worthy charity. If we can agree on one of the two, I am all for making that our primary charity for now. , RT seems safer. It's more in line with what would work in Brazil. Trust me, I'm Brazilian. No amount of passive activism is going to stop these people. Buying the land is a better bet., I agree, staight-up purchasing protected land seems best, and $100 per acre actually means that we can have a legitimate impact. If every subscriber to the sub donated a dollar right now, that's already six-and-a-half acres we can preserve. Not enough to save the World, but a good place to start! , I can afford to donate 50$ each month for the time being, and as I’ve read, it appears as if the majority finds the Rainforest Trust to be the best bet for a charity? If so, I’ll donate to that until the non-profit page opens up., Yeah, that's great man, good stuff! , ","Donation Link(s)","ClimateOffensive",1540807573

Any suggestions for a good place to start, a charity focused on new growth in the region or something? It seems hard to help from the other side of the World (I'm in Europe), so I feel that for now donations to relevant charities operating in the region is the best way to have an impact. , I'm in Europe as well. We can still do loads. We can research, share ideas, fund, organise. This is a global problem which needs help from everyone. We just need to find a few Brazilians with the right mindset and tell them that we are on their side and will help them every step of the way., I agree wholeheartedly! That's exactly the point of this sub. I am already reaching out to a few bigger subs, asking them to join, and I would encourage everyone else to do the same. This is a numbers game - the more we are, the more we can do! , Fellow European checking in, can we also start pressuring the EU to sanction companies with logging activities in the Amazon or other effective measures? There's gotta be something that can be done on that scale as well, I said this in another thread, but here it is - 

Does the EU have a law like the US Lacey Act? This law punishes companies for using illegal goods in their products even if they didn’t know they were illegal. It was amended to include timber and has pushed a lot of US companies to work on sustainable timber sourcing to be in legal compliance, The problem lies not only with the government, but also with the greedy corporate fuckers who want to deforest the place for profit.

Probably not going to happen, but harass the CEO's and directors in public, fuck with their everyday life, make them feel the pain their greed is going to impart on the world. Don't harm them, just make their lives miserable as they deserve. Accidentally spill soda over them, trip and fall against their car with a brick in your hand, shit like that.  


May sound harsh but honestly they are the cancer that is going to end this world... It's time for chemo., If someone wants to research the people behind these logging, cattle, and mining companies that would be great. Try to figure out their holdings so we can boycott them on an international level. , Let’s get some terms right - afforestation is planting trees where they weren’t before. This is not a good solution as there are other important non-forest ecosystems out there.

Reforestation (what I think you are talking about) - planting trees where they were before. Is important and great, but the best strategies are -

Conservation - existing forests are full of biodiversity and carbon in the soil. We need to protect what is in good shape and keep it that way.

Restoration for agriculture - there is a lot of degraded land across the world that is producing at levels far lower than it should. Restoring land for highly productive agriculture will allow more conservation., Not to mention restoration ag will grab carbon out of the atmosphere and put it back in the ground, where it needs to be. 

But maybe it's not all a zero sum game? , TIL - afforestation =/= reforestation. I stand corrected. Thank you., ","We don't just need to stop deforestation, but start afforestation if we are to ever save the Amazon","ClimateOffensive",1540808735

Thanks to /u/Headinclouds100 for starting this sub and I'm happy to help in any capacity needed!, That's awesome! :) Also, props for working on his campaign, that experience could definitely come in handy here! In many ways this initiative could take a lot of inspiration from Bernie's campaign - it needs to be built from the ground up and it depends entirely on people being engaged and optimistic about it! For now, I think the best way to help is just spreading the word and donating in what capacity we can. As to donating to other projects outside of The Amazon preservation, I am all for it! This community started in the wake of the Jair Bolsonaro election, which is why it is focused on The Amazon, but I think we should be open to other initiatives as well - while we are a small, limited movement, I think it makes sense to specify our goal a little more though, which is why we set off focusing on The Amazon. :) , No, I totally get why we started with the Amazon as I also found this sub while reading the thread about Bolsanaro's election. It seems to have been a galvanizing moment for those of us who give a damn about the planet. I brought up the Green Wall initiative because I had heard about it years ago and think we should find a way to help that program as well but in due time. It's great to see that progress is being made in the 10 years since it began though., An August 2018 update on the Great Green Wall from the Smithsonian: [https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/great-green-wall-stop-desertification-not-so-much-180960171/](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/great-green-wall-stop-desertification-not-so-much-180960171/), That's a great report. It really highlights the fact that it needs locally focused action, rather than a blanket policy to make regeneration work. Which is not to say that policies are useless, they do spur action. But the fact is that it's only when you show locals the value of enhancing the soil biology through intelligent and strategic planting, that things really start to change.

We could give out paid tours and camping trips to the conserved areas to gain funds for the organization. We would provide jobs for the guides, and increase tourism in the area. It's a win win for the government and the planet and us., I'd be very careful about bringing tourists into the mix. Tourism has in many places made the ecosystems worse off, Yes, it has. But I'm talking about guided tours. You have to have a guide that accompanies you. In this case, the guide will make sure that the tourists will not negatively impact the environment. 

Besides, tourism in forested areas does not have  big negative impact as most of the demographic interested in it is aware of the importance of the specific environment. 

The biggest negative impact I can think of is resorts or hotel building, but this will not be a problem in this case, as we will have control over the land and will prohibit such a construction. 

Another one is fires, but in the rain-forest is not a big problem because of the humidity. And with a guide he can prevent them by making sure nobody throws out lit cigarettes and leaves campfires unattended. 

The last big issue I can think of is poaching, but if someone wanted to poach they will do it anyways. If we have people constantly touring the zone it will make it harder for them to poach. 

, The argument against poaching is a good one. The more people are there, the less likely would it be to encounter illegal poaching and logging. , It's certainly a great idea, we'll have to keep it in mind. , The problem with Ecotourism is that it requires in many cases transportation by air, which is one of the most polluting ways of moving people. Another risk is that people taking part in those activities think they have already done a good deed for the planet and keep indulging in their normal lifestyle., People will move by air anyways. Most people that would come to such ecotourist destination will chose it versus another local amazonian alternative that is not necessarily as environmentally friendly as us. While coming with us they will know that the funds will go to improve the environment. Our goal is not to prevent people from travelling. 

I see the guided tours as an opportunity to inform, show and teach people first-hand the importance of preserving the amazonian rain forest, and being environmentally conscious. We can demonstrate ways to live off the grid in environmentally friendly ways by showing our shelter that (if it exists) will most certainly be built to the highest standards of sustainability and minimization of environmental impact. We can emphasize the importance of buying wood, meat and produce from environmentally friendly and sustainable sources, among other things. 

I believe people that come to those activities will leave more inspired than before to do the right thing instead of indulging. , ","Ecotourism for fundraising?","ClimateOffensive",1540819814
"17","9sd43q","I don’t know the first place to look but maybe that rainforest trust know how much an acre of rain forest goes for. 

Also anyone know bill gates or warren Buffett personally? , I will quote another comment of mine as to the potential goals here: 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; One of our proposed charities is [Rainforest Trust](https://www.rainforesttrust.org/), who estimate that for every $100, they can preserve one acre of rainforest. For reference, The Amazon was [around 1.7 billion](https://www.brazil.org.za/amazon-rainforest.html) in 2010. How much of that has been deforested since is difficult to say, but if we go by the 2010 numbers, it would theoretically be possible to preserve the whole Amazon for $170 billion. The real figure is probably lower, since a significant portion of The Amazon has been cleared since, but that is a guiding estimate. Either way, that is obviously not a realistic goal, and it is difficult to say whether someone like Bolsonaro would even respect protected land anyway. The point is that it is better than doing nothing, even if we only manage to protect a couple of acres. The other point of the subreddit is to promote information about Climate Change as well as other ways people might be able to take action on it. If we manage to protect significant portions of land, that is a step in the right direction, however small a step that is. 

&amp;nbsp;

As to the realistic goals, that's difficult to say given how fresh this community is. It depends on the level of user engagement, the number of people we can bring aboard and the amount that people are willing/able to donate to the cause. Until such a time as we set up our own crowdfunding campaign, it is difficult to say how much we have raised - which is not really the point either, all that matters here is just that people get active, share the subreddit and donation links, as well as donate what they are able to. That's the mission for now. Hope this clears it up somewhat. , I'm not super informed here but wouldn't the cost of saving each acre go up as more of the Amazon got protected. Its not a commodity so the decrease in supply wouldn't necessarily cause the price to instantly rise but there might be a higher price demanded as more of it got bought up. (I'm not sure how relevant this is mainly just curious and thought it was something to consider for being realistic), I'm all for being realistic! And you're right, it's possible that the price would go up as more land is purchased up. There is no mention of that on Rainforest Trust's page, so there is no way for us to know for sure. According to their statement, $100 buys an acre, so that is the figure we have to go on, until we know anything else. Like I said, the $170 billion is just a really rough estimate, and that's going by 2010 numbers for the mass of The Amazon anyway, so it's probably not accurate for 2018. And in any case, crowdfunding $170 billion from us here on Reddit is probably being a tad overambitious too, so let's just shoot for as much money as possible and be content with that for now. :) , That last part was funny :D
, Money invested properly in etfs can achieve a fairly good long term rate of return. One of the tools for retirement planning is a 3.5-4% safe withdraw amount. At this level you can withdraw that amount each year, and allow for inflation, and continue to do this indefinitely. Ie if a fund has $100m you can take out $4m each year (inflation adjusted), forever. This approach would be a better long term solution to funding, although it would sacrafice the immediate actionability of those funds., Really like the suggestion here, while grassroots funding is important, a steady source of income will provide us with real stability. I'll make a funding related post to discuss this further. , Agreed. Our short sightedness as a species is what got us in this mess in the first place.

If things are going as they are projected I fear there'll be little to nothing left to salvage when it comes to the Amazon and the devastating impact complete exploitation will have worldwide. I feel that in addition to these initiatives we have to do more, and use whatever means necessary.

[According to the EC](http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/brazil/) the EU accounts for 18.3% of Brazil's export, along with being the biggest foreign investor. Based on these facts, I'd argue it's safe to say the EU can exert considerable (economic) pressure when it comes to protecting the Amazon.

I think we as citizens of the EU could consider launching a [Citizen's initiative](http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/basic-facts), as a means of taking action. [The EC's website also details whether an idea can be a Citizen's Initiative](http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/competences#treaties). I will detail here why I think it can be:

First, this idea would require the EC to actually have any power in its relevant policy era. I'd argue it does in the policies of [External Trade](https://europa.eu/european-union/topics/trade_en) and [Environment](https://europa.eu/european-union/topics/environment_en). For this, I cite these 2 passages in the previous links emphasis on the text in **bold**:
&gt;EU trade policy also aims to reduce child and forced labour, **environmental destruction** and price volatility. Schemes which ensure transparency and traceability in supply chains are one example.

&gt; More action is needed to ensure that air, oceans and other water resources are kept clean **land and ecosystems are used sustainably**.

&gt;As a global actor, **the EU plays a key role in international efforts to promote sustainable development globally**.

Based on this, I would say that an idea like this could be a Citizen's Initiative. Though I would like to reiterate, I have zero knowledge about launching something like this and how to spread &amp; gain support for it. Additionally, a CI needs at least 7 citizens from 7 different EU member states to even start.

What do you, as fellow EU citizen, think of this idea? Would you be willing to help out? Do you have experience or know people with experience who would be willing to help give shape to something like this? , I think it's an excellent idea.

I think also that as you get this subreddit going, you're going to have to repeat yourself.  Is there somewhere that you can collect all the actions that are being contemplated?, Good point.

If you’re looking at a landslide race or one of the few places where it is Green versus Dem, then by all means vote Green or socialist or whatever.

Hillary would have maintained the Clean Power Plan, kept the US in the Paris Agreement and many other things.

Instead we have Trump who is destroying all kinds of environmental protections because Hillary wasn’t pure enough for people. Things like fuel efficiency standards change things for everyone and give us all better options - policies matter for the environment.

What's your sense of what this means? I'd say worker ownership of companies and some sort of constitutional convention. , &gt; Remember the weather underground eh?

I’m actually not familiar with this. What’s the history?

As for changing the system - giving workers at least partial ownership of companies and strengthening unions are huge. We also need to get more citizens active and involved in politics - voting, contacting representatives, running for office, and just paying attention to what their reps are actually doing. Updating the US constitution would also be extremely helpful, but I don’t see that going well for us in the current political climate.

On the environmental-specific, we need to support good existing environmental groups to give them the resources they need, and to build economic incentives for companies to pursue more sustainable practices by buying from and investing in green technologies.

That’s just a couple things off the top of my head, but there’s a lot more that we can do, and I’m glad this sub is talking about this stuff!!
, The Weather Underground was a militant offshoot of the radical left. They were active around the same time as the Panthers' most violent period. 

The government backlash against them and their bombing campaigns is part of the reason our modern intelligence service are so handy and infiltrating and disrupting dissident leftist groups. 

There is an eponymous and super worthwhile documentary about them. I recommend it!, Oh wow. That sounds like a fascinating watch.

If you believe you've thought of something particularly innovative, also feel free to share. , I'll go first. I've seen some videos about how ash, soot, and otherwise darkened matter is drifting onto glaciers in the arctic. This leaves darkened spots on the glaciers, and therefore absorbs more light in contrast to the reflective white glaciers. These spots eventually melt down and turn into holes, absorbing more light and melting into river that undercut glaciers and flow out into the sea. Enough of these are what is cutting slices off of the ice shelves. I've wondered what it would take to cover these spots up, and if done in a hole if it would allow it to refreeze. Perhaps the holes need to be refilled. As cartoonish as plugging holes in glaciers might sound, I think it could work and should be tried, the alternative seems to be to let the ice shelves go. , I want to start collecting natural gas from melting permafrost instead of fracking. I know it’s not really fixing the climate issue to the same extent as leaving it in the ground, but the melting permafrost means *that* natural gas is not gonna stay in the ground regardless. Still better than the way things are currently going., I can't see that happening without surrendering the earth's permafrost, which the climate can't afford. The worst globalized problem around fracking is its release of methane, which is considerably worse of an issue when you start talking about exposing permafrost. , The permafrost is already thawing. It's just a matter of time, We can't be content to sit back and watch it happen. I will make a separate post on the topic. , At this point the temperature changes associated with climate change are inevitable and irreversible. There is not much we can do to prevent permafrost melt in the battle against climate change, https://youtu.be/IWnlPYu3ovQ, I think it would be too diffuse to get a useable quantity., I think that we need to put more pressure on the richest people. Maybe by creating a globally viral video, which will try to make people aware of how much more they could do. , If anyone has the expertise, this is a great idea, Yeah, another idea would be networking with rich people, but ideally somebody would already be well connected in those circles. It takes precious time to build up something from scratch. , What about an equivalent to the X-prize? That one gave a big boost to civilian/commercial space travel. What about a big X-prize type of contest, with the prize going to any technology that can:
- scrub CO2 from the atmosphere 
- grow meat/milk in the lab at competitive (i.e., McDonalds) prices
- increase battery efficiency by 50% at least

And a long _et cetera_..., Dismantle every HOA stipulation that lawns must be as close to golf courses as possible. Normalize wild yards. Minimal mowing, increased soil health, biodiversity, habitat for insects/animals. 

Might be a little too high up the hopium ladder but HEMP EVERYWHERE!, Start regulating cryptocurrency mining. The amount of power they consume just to mine and move the tokens is insane., Perhaps we should think about building some kind of priority list of ideas? Weight them by different criteria such as feasibility, cost, effort etc. 

?, This is not so much about climate change, but it is trying to reduce the huge amounts of garbage produced:

When you walk in a supermarket aisle, you see that every brand has a different package for the exactly same product (with the exception of milk). My suggestion would be to standardize packages across different product categories. This would make machine sorting and recycling much simpler. Also manufactures could agree on a package that is practical, but does not use excess material. , I like the  business model of Ecosia a lot. Ecosia has been mentioned in another thread here already, they are a search engine that donate a great percentage of their digital ad revenue to reforestation efforts.
I really like this type of business model and am thinking that it could be repeated. It’s not about building the next billion dollar company, but rather about building a company that offers one good service, and contributes a large amount of the income for good causes.

I’m thinking my private funds for donating are and will always be limited, but maybe I could help to build some web service of that type which could generate much more money than I could ever donate.

I’m not having a clear plan, but would be willing to invest time into thinking more about this/brainstorming etc ...

Any ideas/thoughts?, I definitely like the idea of using a for profit business model that donates profits to good causes, but from what I understand one has to be careful in the U.S. or else lost their tax exempt status. It's a muddy legal area, and I'm very curious as to how Ecosia operates around it if at all. 
There is great potential for passive income earnings for non-profits however, which is perfectly legal. A non-profit could then have a steady source of income through dividends and real estate. , ","Idea Pool","ClimateOffensive",1540866867

&amp;#x200B;

I've done a lot of thinking for a while now, about the world and where we are headed. Right now, to me, I feel like committing suicide. I can escape, and make the world not have to feed one more person. It feels so hopeless, this is really the only option that makes sense to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone else feel this way?, One less mouth to feed dont make a difference, just enjoy ride, the world needs more people like you that cares about the enviroment., If everyone had the ""One less X doesn't make a difference,"" then no progress would have ever been made in human history.

Not trying to bash you, I admire the optimistic pessimism, but I've been legitimately depressed about the way things are for us as a species. , Just like Fenris said, one less mouth to feed won't make a difference. But staying alive and fighting back can make a difference! I know, it really feels hopeless sometimes, but just don't give up yet. People like you are the people we need and if we want to make a difference we must unite and fight back., As I said to Fenris: "" If everyone had the 'One less X doesn't make a difference,' then no progress would have ever been made in human history.""

&amp;#x200B;

Much the same to you here. I don't mean to attack you in any way, but from the way I see things we are almost done. I am confident I wont have children, and if I do, they will inherit a dead or dying world.

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to believe that we can change things, but the odds are against us. So much so that the only way for humanity to truly do anything is when doom is on our front door. Nobody listens or cares until the issue is right in front of them, and by then it will more than likely be too late.

&amp;#x200B;

We can only adapt so fast, and the world is changing faster than we can adapt.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if I am draining the positivity from anyone who reads, Nah, to be honest I agree with you. I won't have children and yes the odds are against us. [But we still have time to fight back](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2018/10/07/world/climate-change-new-ipcc-report-wxc/index.html?__twitter_impression=true) although it is not a lot of time. Personally, I just want to fight back. If we are truly doomed then at least I will go down fighting.

You are not draining the positivity. I really understand how you feel., I do feel your pain, and I want to commend you for reaching out. The greed driven insanity destroying the planet effects us all differently, and I believe that the wounds inflicted on our world can cause wounds in us as well. 
For me, the current state of the climate has instilled a sort of restlessness in me. I could never be content to have a family and a nice job and just live my life while the world burns. 
Even if futile, action is the only way forward.
 If you die you may end your own pain but the world will suffer on without you, and it will be worse off. 
If you face this evil, and commit yourself to fighting it, I believe you'll find a life worth living. Help us do some real good. You matter. , I think that by staying alive, I can at least contribute to my election with 1 vote for a pro environment party. I've made my family eat more vegetarian than ever before and have influenced the people around me to care more. Also, thoughts of suicide kind of means you've got nothing to lose? Like doing things that might seem scary but it makes the world a better place? Please don't take your life. What the world needs right now is people who care and want to do something. Not less., I’ve been struggling with these same thoughts as well. I’m really pushing myself to think about how if I go, it’s one less person fighting for what’s right, and essentially letting the “evil” side win. I’m trying to get some therapy sessions scheduled as well. I’m sorry I don’t have better advice like others have posted. These are new feelings for me and it’s overwhelming trying to figure them out. Please PM me if you need to talk to somebody who’s going through this too ❤️, The way I think of it, is that if someone is committed he can have a net positive impact on the world by fixing the shit that others are causing or the shit that just happens. For example, if you set yourself the goal to be carbon negative, then you can join reforestation programs, or just create your own. Support anti CO2 policies. Research methods of absorbing CO2 from the air. Change other peoples mind, and make them change for the better. 

You can have  a positive impact on the world, and make it less fucked than how you found it, at least in a small way, if you set your mind, soul, and body to it. 

As other said, one more mouth to feed will not have a big impact. While you can have a big impact if you chose to. And to counter your argument of ""If everyone had the 'One less X doesn't make a difference,' then no progress would have ever been made in human history."" imagine if every environmentalist killed himself to save the planet from his carbon footprint. Then the only people left in the world are the people that are actively fucking it for profit, or neglect. The world would truly go to shit then, as there is nobody to stop it from doing that. 

Depression sucks dude, I understand. Talk to your family and friends about this, I'm sure they care about you and will help you out. If you have nobody you can feel free to PM me whenever you want. We can talk, game a little, or even meet up if you're in the same area as me. When I'm depressed I'm apathetic. I don't think I can accomplish anything useful. But I fight on towards my goals. Give yourself goals that you can pursue, so you have something to fight for even when you feel depressed. Something to get you off the bed. Make it achievable. Start small if you need it, but also aim high, and fight towards that direction. The goal will change overtime. Maybe it will not be possible to accomplish it. But if you move in that direction you will still be doing something worthwhile. 

You will come through dude, and I'm sure you will have a net positive impact on the world and it's environment. You just gotta work towards it. , ","A suggestion","ClimateOffensive",1540880685
"27","9slszz","This post will be to discuss permafrost melt in the Arctic, a massive global issue. 
For those unaware, permafrost is the layer of permanately frozen soil beneath the ground in places like Siberia, Alaska, and Northern Canada. As these blocks of frozen soil melt, often for the first time in thousands of years, microbes begin to consume the thawed material and excrete methane, a greenhouse gas even more potent than carbon. Huge depressions in Siberia have opened up, forming lakes which draw more heat in due to their darker coloring, and leak massive volumes of methane. 
I am only familiar with one non-profit actively fighting against permafrost melt, a project called Pleistocene Park. The goal is to reintroduce large herbivores to the otherwise barren arctic to trample snow. Russian scientist and founder Sergey Zimov has studied how the removal of snow layers in the winter breaks the insulating effect of snow, allowing the permafrost to freeze deeper. His goal is to revive the ecosystem that existed ten thousand years ago , the arctic grasslands known as the Mammoth Steppe, and has been using donations to collect animals for his park in Siberia. http://pleistocenepark.org , Never heard of this before., Here's a good recap https://youtu.be/XOkfOLbSE6o , ","Permafrost Melt","ClimateOffensive",1540885988

Brazil is a deeply catholic nation and the Vatican has made its message about the environment clear.

So I wonder, is it possible to ask the Catholic Church to help us?, It's not a terrible idea, although I struggle to see what practical help they could give.

The story broke via the National Geographic. Google blood ivory.

Hoping the Vatican will help you? I'd actually be more concerned they would offer to buy the timber...

While the Church has enormous clout... getting it to support this is in my opinion unlikely...

And yes there has been consequences and press releases after the story broke...
My point is they were happy to be involved  in the ivory trade until the spotlight was put upon them... , The Pope will be behind this 100%. But the Church is a massive beast that doesn’t move nimbly. Organizing and support at a grassroots level is more likely, and something that priests and nuns have been doing in Latin America for decades.
